> Add Standalone profile support in Jhipster applications

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application. During development, especially in micro-service architecture, to access secure micro-service endpoint, you often need to start `Jhipster Registry` and `UAA` / `OpenID connect` server. Scaling, security are not concerns during development and often adds an additional overhead.

To simplify development experience, this module adds new spring boot `standalone` profile and integrates with corresponding `standalone` maven profile. It is an add-on profile like `no-liquibase` and should be used along with main profile like `dev`.

This module supports following authentication types:
- OIDC
- UAA
- JWT

This module supports following discovery services:
- Jhipster Registry (Eureka)

# Pre-requisites
