### Standalone Development

During backend development, you can disable cross cutting concerns (discovery, security, cors etc), with an add-on standalone profile. Simply run:

    ./mvnw -Pdev,standalone

To start frontend in standalone mode, use following script:

    %clientPackageManager% start:standalone
